Interpolation



Monomial Interpolation:
	-To interpolate, create vandermonde matrix
	-then solve vand \ b
	-If you have deg n polynomial, then you need n+1 x n+1 size vandermonde matrix

Lagrange Interpolation:


Newton Interpolation:
	-used divided differences to build table
	-use coefficients on the diagonal of the table

Cubic Hermite Spline Interpolation:
	-Interpolate between consecutive points linearly
	-we want smooth behaviour for second behaviour, so we add a few more constraints
	-this is a lot more expensive and it is underdetermined system
	-hermite functions can resolve this issue
